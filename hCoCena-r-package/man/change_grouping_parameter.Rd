\usage{
change_grouping_parameter(
  group_by,
  col_order = NULL,
  cluster_columns = T,
  row_order = NULL,
  cluster_rows = T
)
}
\arguments{
\item{group_by}{A string giving the new grouping variable. This must be a name of a column present in all annotation files.}

\item{col_order}{Defines the order in which the sample groups (conditions) appear in the heatmap.
Accepts a vector of strings giving the conditions in their desired order, default is NULL (automatic order, determined by clustering).
If the parameter cluster_columns is not set to FALSE, this order will be overwritten.}

\item{cluster_columns}{A Boolean, whether or not to cluster the columns of the heatmap. Default is TRUE, overwrites col_order.}

\item{row_order}{Like col_order but with cluster names.}

\item{cluster_rows}{Like cluster_columns but for rows.}
}
\description{
The variable by which the samples are grouped and based on which the GFCs are calculated can be changed and the cluster heatmap will be replotted.
This is particularly useful in cases where different variables are potential candidates for driving the genesâ€™ expression changes in the data
and an explorative approach is required to decide on the most suitable one.
Note that any previously generated column annotation will not be plotted, since the grouping will change.
If you eventually decide on another grouping variable, please run the analysis again entirely with the changed "voi" from the very beginning.
