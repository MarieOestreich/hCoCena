\usage{
run_expression_analysis_1(
  padj = "none",
  export = F,
  import = NULL,
  bayes = F,
  prior = 2,
  alpha = 0.5,
  corr_method = "pearson"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{padj}{A String. Defines the method to be used for p-value adjustment. Valid values are "none" (default) or values for "method" in stats::p.adjust.}

\item{export}{A Boolean. If TRUE, correlation values and p-values will be exported.
This can save time if you plan on re-running the analysis since computing pari-wise correlations is a bottleneck of the analysis. Default is FALSE.}

\item{import}{A list. Each slot in the list corresponds to one of the layers (datasets) and is either a vector of two strings (1. path to file holding the correlation matrix and
2. Path to the file holding the p-value matrix) or NA. A list slot is set to NA if for that layer you do not want to import a pre-calculated correlation matrix.
The files do not necessarily have to be exported from a previous run, but can have any kind of origin (created with a different program or method).
For compatibility it is only important, that it is a whitespace-separated text (.txt) file containing a symmetric, numeric matrix.
The first line has to be gene names, there must be no row names, since the first line will be used for column names and row names.
Also, you must provide a matrix with correlation values AND a matrix with corresponding p-values, where cells in the matrices correspond to each other (only a correlation matrix will not be sufficient).
Default is NULL.}

\item{bayes}{Sánchez-Taltavull et al. (2016) suggest superiority of Bayesian correlation analysis to Pearson correlation in some cases.
Therefore, the Pearson correlation values can be weighted with Bayesian correlation values. To do so, set the “bayes”-parameter to TRUE. Default is FALSE, using only Pearson correlations.}

\item{prior}{An integer, either 2 or 3, using prior 2 or 3 for the Bayes weighting as described in "Bayesian correlation analysis for sequence count data" by Sánchez-Taltavull et al. (2016).}

\item{alpha}{A numeric value from 0 to 1. Allows to adjust the strength of the Bayes weighting: For alpha = 0 the Pearson correlation values remain unaltered, for alpha = 1 the Pearson correlation value and the Bayesian correlation value contribute equally to the final correlation.}

\item{corr_method}{Default is "pearson", but can alternatively be set to "spearman".}

\description{
This function executes the frist part of the data processing procedure. It leads up to choosing the correlation cut-off for each layer.
All datasets will be filtered for their most variant genes as defined in the layer-specific settings.
After this filtering step, the pair-wise Pearson correlation coefficients for all pairs of genes are calculated.
Correlations that are negative or that have an associated p-value higher than 0.05 are immediately discarded.
Next, a set of statistics will be calculated for the set range of cut-off values that aim to facilitate the cut-off choice.
This includes determining the number of graph components resulting from creating a network when cutting the data with the respective cut-off,
as well as the number of nodes and edges this network comprises.
The last parameter that is evaluated is the R²-value of the data to a linear regression through the logged degree distribution for the given network.
