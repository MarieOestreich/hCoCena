\title{Compare clusters of 2 networks}
\usage{
network_comparison_1(
  gtc1_path,
  gtc2_path,
  sep = "\\t",
  header = TRUE,
  cellsize = 18
)
}
\arguments{
\item{gtc1_path}{File path to a 'gtc'-file (gene-to-clsuter) of the first network: Essentially just a file with two columns, the first containing gene symbols and the second
giving the cluster each gene belongs to. Such a file can be generated during an hCoCena analysis using the function 'hcocena::export_clusters()', but as long as
the described structure is preserved it can also be generated manually elsewhere.}

\item{gtc2_path}{See 'gtc1_path', only for network 2.}

\item{sep}{The separator of the 'gtc'-file. Default is tab-separated.}

\item{header}{A Boolean. Whether or not the file has headers (column names).}

\item{cellsize}{The size of the cells/tiles in the plotted heatmap. Default is 18, may be adjusted for aestetics reasons.}
}
\value{
The heatmap object for replotting/re-sizing etc. and the result matrix. Output can be found under hcobject$satellite_outputs$network_comparison_1
}
\description{
This function calculates and visualizes the Jaccard-Index of all pairs of clusters from two networks.
This allows the comparison of the two networks with respect to the clusters they form and how those clusters relate to each other.
