set_layer_settings(
  top_var,
  min_corr = 0.7,
  range_cutoff_length,
  print_distribution_plots = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{top_var}{A vector with the length equal to the number of datasets/layers. Each entry of the vector is either "all" or an integer.
Defines the number of most variable genes to be extracted per dataset. The order in the vector corresponds to the order in which the datasets have been declared in define_layers().}

\item{min_corr}{A vector of floats with the length equal to the number of datasets/layers. To construct a meaningful co-expression network for each layer, correlation cut-offs must be determined for every dataset that mark the lower boundary for the correlation
of two genes in order for their co-expression to be represented as an edge in the network. To facilitate choosing these cut-offs, a series of parameters will be calculated for a defined number of different cut-offs.
The number of cut-offs for which these parameters are calculated is determined by 'range_cutoff_length'.
The range from which these possible cut-offs are taken is on the lower end restricted by 'min_corr' and on the upper end by the maximum correlation calculated between any two genes in the dataset. Default is 0.7.}

\item{range_cutoff_length}{A vector of integers with the length equal to the number of datasets/layers. Details see "min_corr".}

\item{print_distribution_plots}{A vector of Booleans with the length equal to the number of datasets/layers. Whether or not to print the degree distribution plots for all tested cut-offs to pdf files.
The number of plots per data set will therefore be equal to the 'range_cutoff_length' parameter you have set.
Given the potential size, this should only be set to TRUE, if 'range_cutoff_length' is small or if one wishes to thoroughly analyse how the degree distribution changes in detail for differing cut-offs.
Default is FALSE.}
