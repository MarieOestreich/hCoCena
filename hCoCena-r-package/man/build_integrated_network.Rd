\usage{
build_integrated_network(
  mode = "u",
  with = NULL,
  multi_edges = "min",
  GFC_when_missing = -hcobject[["global_settings"]][["range_GFC"]]
)
}
\arguments{
\item{mode}{A string, either "u", if network integration is to be done by union (default), or "i", if integration is to be done by intersection.
For details please refer to the information pages provided in the repository's Wiki.}

\item{with}{Either an integer giving the number of the dataset to be used as reference (e.g., 1) or the name given to the layer.
Can be ignored when integration is done by union.}

\item{multi_edges}{One of “min”, “mean” or “max” resulting in the simplification of the multigraph by using the minimum, the mean or the maximum edge weight among the multiple edges, respectively.
Multiple edges occur when the edge was present in more than one datset.}

\item{GFC_when_missing}{The value to substitute missing data in the case where some genes were not measured in all but only some of the datasets.}
}
\description{
The previously constructed layer-specific networks are being integrated.
