\usage{
run_expression_analysis_2(
  grouping_v = NULL,
  plot_HM = T,
  method = "complete",
  additional_anno = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{grouping_v}{A string giving a column name present in all annotation files, if this variable shall be used for grouping the samles isntead of the variable of interest. Default is NULL.}

\item{plot_HM}{A Boolean. Whether or not to plot the heatmap (for networks with many genes this may be very demanding for your computer if you are running the analysis locally). Default is TRUE.}

\item{method}{The method used for clustering the heatmap in the pheatmap function. Default is "complete".}

\item{additional_anno}{A list, with one slot per data set. A slot contains a vector of column names from that data set’s annotation file that you wish to annotate with.
If for some of the data sets you don’t wish any further annotation, you can set the corresponding list slot to NULL. Default is NULL.}
}
\description{
This function plots a heatmap for the network genes in each data layer and computes the Group-Fold-Changes for all genes per layer.
